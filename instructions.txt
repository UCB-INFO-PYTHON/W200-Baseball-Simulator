The year is 2014 and you are a GM in the MLB. After a snide remark from your
team owner that the players had a better chance getting a hit with their eyes
closed, you decide to test the theory.

In this game, you'll give each batter the sign to swing or watch the next
pitch, without seeing it first. The player's past plate appearances will
determine whether they swing and miss, hit into a play, or maybe even get a
home run. Each player's odds are based on their plate appearances from 2003 to
2013.

The commands are:

    [s] = swing at the incoming pitch
    [w] = watch, do not swing at, the pitch
    [h] = access the help screen for definitions, suggestions & details
    [q] = quit the game in progress

As the home team, you'll only play the bottom of each inning. Basic rules apply
(3 strikes is a strike out, 4 balls is a walk, 3 outs an inning, etc.).
Batting orders use dodgeball rules -- last out goes to the end of the line.

You're almost ready, but before the first pitch is thrown you need to make
some coaching decisions.
